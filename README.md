# DH100-MusicGenres

This project aims to analyze the vast amount of musical genres found on Spotify through the use of their API.
The focus of this analysis is on the variability found in each genre's attributes. These attributes range from energy level, valence (positive mood), and acousticness.
Popular music is also analyzed for their variation through data collected from the Billboard Charts and passed through the Spotify API. The variation of popular music is tracked throughout the years.
